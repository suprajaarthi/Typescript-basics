//modularity is used generally in typescript to tell if a variable or a class or interface or whatever to lie // out of the file by default using Export kw
//model driven approach  is used to share the code basically


// TypeScript is modular, we can divide our code up over several files
// In Angular 2 we then use  "import {} from ''" to access the code in these files

// We export a class, interface, variable, ... by adding 'export' keyword in front of it

export class ExportedClass {
    // This class is exported
    }
